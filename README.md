# Object Tracking and Speed Detection System

This is a Python-based project that detects moving objects in a video and calculates their approximate speed using frame difference techniques. It simulates a basic traffic surveillance system and can be used as a foundation for more advanced computer vision tasks like vehicle recognition or license plate detection.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Features

- Object detection using contour-based methods
- Speed estimation based on frame rate and pixel movement
- Visual indication of tracked objects and speed on video frames
- Works with pre-recorded video or webcam feed
